Beat Saber Custom Song Repair Tool

I have noticed recently that many custom songs won't load (endless spinning animation when selecting the song) on vanilla (unmodified) Beat Saber.
A common problem seam to be that the version info appears in the wrong spot in the .dat files.
This tool is an automated way to attempt to fix such issues.
This tool don't claim to be able to fix all songs, since there could be other problems as well.

Select a custom song using browse button, and hit repair to attempt to repair it.
If the song has no detectable problems, nothing will be done to its files.
